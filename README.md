# sign-language-detector
This project utilizes OpenCV, TensorFlow, and machine learning techniques to develop a system that can detect and interpret sign language gestures in real-time. By processing video input and recognizing hand movements and shapes, the system aims to bridge communication gaps for the hearing-impaired community.
